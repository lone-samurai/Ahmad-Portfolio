# Ahmad-Portfolio
My first project here on Github- a portfolio! It was possible all thanks to Start Bootstrap with the portfolio-resume layout.
With it, I was able to refresh on HTML, CSS, and Java. I've really enjoyed this first step and intend to expand on making it more responsive or a seperate project at least.
I'm very excited to continue on!
